📖** Overview **

The **Theory of Computation Tracker** is not just a video player; it is a **compliance-focused** **Learning Management System \(LMS\) module**. 

Designed to solve the problem of passive consumption in online learning, this tool tracks user engagement with **second-by-second precision**. It utilizes the browser's DOM events to prevent background playback, ensuring that students are actively viewing the lecture material before generating a signed progress report. 

🎯** Key Features **

🖥** Immersive Interface **

● **Dark Mode Native:** A sleek, high-contrast UI inspired by premium streaming platforms, designed to reduce eye strain during long coding lectures. 

● **Responsive Playlist:** Sidebar navigation with real-time thumbnail updates. 

🛡** Academic Integrity \(Anti-Cheat\) **

● **Focus Enforcement:** Leveraging the **Page Visibility API**, the video automatical y pauses if the user switches tabs, minimizes the browser, or covers the window. 

● **No-Skip Policy:** Scrubbing controls are managed to encourage linear consumption of complex theoretical topics. 

📊** Granular Analytics **

● **Real-Time Persistence:** Progress is saved to localStorage every second. Closing the browser doesn't mean losing your place. 

● **Visual Feedback:** Dynamic progress bars overlay on video thumbnails in the sidebar. 

● **Verifiable Reports:** Generates a downloadable .txt report card with a cryptographic-style summary of watched content for submission. 

🛠** Technical Architecture** This project is built with **Vanilla JavaScript** to ensure maximum performance and zero dependencies. 

Component 

Technology 

Role 

**Frontend **

HTML5 / CSS3 

Responsive Flexbox/Grid layout 

with custom CSS variables for 

theming. 

**Logic **

ES6\+ JavaScript 

Handles state management, 

event listeners, and DOM 

manipulation. 

**Video Engine **

**YouTube IFrame API **

Al ows programmatic control 

over the video player \(pause, 

play, get time\). 

**State **

localStorage 

Persists user data across 

sessions without a backend 

database. 

**Sensors **

document.hidden 

Detects tab switching events to 

trigger the auto-pause 

mechanic. 

🚀** Getting Started **

**Prerequisites **

No instal ation is required to use the tracker. It is a client-side web application. 

**Usage Guide **

1. **Launch:** Open the Hosted Tracker. 

2. **Select:** Choose a lecture from the "Theory of Computation" playlist on the right. 

3. **Watch:** Keep the tab **focused**. 

○ *Note: If you switch tabs to check Discord or Instagram, the video wil pause* *immediately. *

4. **Track:** Observe the progress bar fil ing up on the sidebar thumbnail. 

5. **Export:** Navigate to the **"Analytics & Download" ** tab and click **"Download Progress** **Report" ** to generate your submission file. 

**Local Development \(Optional\) **

If you wish to modify the code or contribute: 

\# Clone the repository 

git clone 

\[https://github.com/aryan-singh19/Students\_View.git\]\(https://github.co m/aryan-singh19/Students\_View.git\) 



\# Navigate to the directory cd Students\_View 



\# Open index.html in your browser 

\# OR use a simple http server \(recommended for API stability\) npx serve . 



📂** Project Structure **

├── style.css \# Custom dark-mode styling and animations 

├── script.js \# Core logic: API integration, focus tracking, and analytics 

├── assets/ \# Icons and static resources 

└── README.md \# Documentation 



⚠** Troubleshooting **

● **Progress not saving? ** Ensure you are not using **Incognito/Private Mode**, as localStorage is cleared when the tab closes in private windows. 

● **Video not playing? ** Some ad-blockers may interfere with the YouTube IFrame API. Try disabling them for this site if issues persist.
